# Churn_Analysis
Churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn.


# Customer-Churn-Prediction
Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service.

This case requires developing a model for predicting customer churn at a fictitious wireless telecom company and use insights from the model to develop an
incentive plan for enticing would-be churners to remain with company.

## Dataset
Data for the case are available in csv 'Churn-1'.
The data are a scaled down version of the full database generously donated by an anonymous wireless telephone company.
There are still 7043 customers in the database, and 20 potential predictors.
The data is available in one data file with 7043 rows that combines the calibration and validation customers. “calibration” database consisting of 4000 customers and a “validation” database consisting of 3043 customers.
Each database contained (1) a “churn” variable signifying whether the customer had left the company two months after observation, and (2) a set of 20 potential predictor variables that could be used in a predictive churn model.
